/**
 * Write-through cache: This holds entries until they are invalidated by subsequent updates
 * <p>
 * In practice, an ideal cache will feature a combination of both the features so that the entries will be held for a
 * known maximum time, but will also pass around invalidations as changes are made.
 * <p>
 * The first major feature of Hazelcast is its masterless nature. Each node is configured to be functionally the
 * same and operates in a peer-to-peer manner. The oldest node in the cluster is the de facto leader.
 * This node manages the membership by automatically making decisions as to which node is responsible for which data.
 * In this way, as the new nodes join in or drop out, the process is repeated and the cluster rebalances accordingly.
 * This makes it incredibly simple to get Hazelcast up and running, as the system is self-discovering,
 * self-clustering, and works straight out of the box
